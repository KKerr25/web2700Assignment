        <p>
          In 2021, a survey found that 13% of Americans have a disability. About 38.9 million adults in the U.S. have a
          disability, and 19.7% of them are poor. This is almost twice the number of non-disabled adults who are poor.
          One reason for this is that fewer disabled people have jobs. In the U.S., 25.9% of disabled people over age 16
          have jobs, compared to 59.6% of all Americans over age 16.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Utah, 10.3% of people have a disability, which is about 342,378 people. In the whole U.S., 13% of people
          have a disability, which is about 42.5 million people. There are differences between genders and types of
          disabilities in Utah and the U.S. There are several reasons for these differences, but that's not the focus
          here. When looking at disabilities by race, Utah and the U.S. have some differences. In Utah, there are more
          disabilities among Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiâ€™ian and Other
          Pacific Islander, and Hispanic or Latino communities compared to the whole U.S. However, the White community
          in Utah has fewer disabilities than the national rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we consider the number of people with disabilities in the U.S. (about 40 million) and in Utah (about
          350,000), we see why it's important to create accessible experiences for everyone.

        <p>
          Tim Berners-Lee, who created the web, knew that making the web accessible to everyone is important: "The power
          of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless is an essential aspect."
        </p>
        <p>This website follows the principles of Universal Design by Ronald Mace and his team:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Equitable Use</strong>: The design is useful for people with different abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility in Use</strong>: The design suits different preferences and abilities.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple and Intuitive Use</strong>: The design is easy to understand, no matter the user's experience
            or skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perceptible Information</strong>: The design shares information effectively, regardless of the
            user's senses or environment.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Tolerance for Error</strong>: The design reduces risks and consequences of mistakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Physical Effort</strong>: The design is comfortable to use with little effort.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use</strong>: The design allows easy access and use, regardless of
            body size or mobility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website also meets the Level AA requirements of WCAG 2.1 for web accessibility.</p>
