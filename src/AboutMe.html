        <p>
          I work full-time in construction as a foreman, a role that requires leadership, expertise, and a strong work
          ethic. Overseeing operations and managing teams on various projects allows me to contribute to the success of
          my company while honing my skills in coordination and problem-solving. My position is one I take great pride
          in, as it combines responsibility with opportunities for growth in a demanding field.

        />
        <p>
          Family is incredibly important to me, and I treasure the moments I get to spend with my loved ones. Whether
          it’s enjoying a peaceful walk together or sharing everyday experiences, I value these connections and believe
          they play a vital role in maintaining strong relationships. My life reflects a balance of hard work, personal
          passions, and meaningful relationships that define who I am.

        Accessibility is about ensuring equal access and opportunity for all, regardless of abilities. It’s not just a
        technical requirement; it’s an act of empathy that fosters inclusion and connection. On the web, accessibility
        allows everyone to engage, learn, and navigate without limitations. By designing for accessibility, creators
        break down barriers and celebrate diversity through thoughtful choices. It transforms the web into a space that
        truly belongs to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automated tools like WebAIM's WAVE are useful for catching technical accessibility issues but can't identify
        more subjective barriers, such as poor user experience for individuals with cognitive disabilities. They are
        unable to assess content clarity or confirm that navigation flows well for all users. Combining automated tools
        with manual and user testing ensures a more thorough evaluation of accessibility.

          <h4 id="standards-title">Accessibility Standards I Use</h4>
          <p>
            I follow accessibility standards like WCAG to ensure websites are easy to use for everyone. This includes
            using alt text, clear navigation, and proper HTML structure to make content accessible. I also ensure
            compatibility with assistive technologies.

          <h4 id="inclusion-title">Why Inclusion During Design/Development Matters</h4>
          <p>
            Including people with diverse abilities in design and testing helps uncover barriers and create better
            solutions. It ensures the final product works well for all users and demonstrates a commitment to equity and
            inclusion.

      <h4>Accessibility Statement</h4>
      <p>
        The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve
        accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level
        AAA. Konrad's Accessible Site is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Fully conformant means that the
        content fully conforms to the accessibility standard without any exceptions.
