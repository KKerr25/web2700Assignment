        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>
          Original Paragraph: The environmental impacts of urbanization have been significant, particularly concerning
          the increase in air pollution levels and the reduction in green spaces due to the expansion of infrastructure.
          Cities have been experiencing a rise in air pollutants resulting from increased vehicular emissions and
          industrial activities. This has been exacerbated by the reduction in natural environments, which has decreased
          the capacity for city landscapes to filter out pollution naturally. Noise pollution has also become
          predominant, with the increasing population density leading to a surge in transportation noise and general
          urban activity. These environmental challenges have prompted cities to adopt various measures aimed at
          mitigating their impacts, such as the implementation of green roofs and the creation of urban parks. Moreover,
          public transportation systems have been expanded and improved to reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Efforts
          to promote sustainable practices are continuing, as are initiatives to enhance urban resilience in the face of
          environmental challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revised Paragraph: Urbanization increases air pollution and reduces green spaces. Cities face higher
          pollutants from more vehicles and industries, worsened by fewer natural areas to filter pollution. Noise
          pollution has risen with population density. Cities mitigate impacts with green roofs, parks, and expanded
          public transport. Sustainable practices enhance urban resilience.
        </p>
