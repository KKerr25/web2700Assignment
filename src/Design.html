          Good visual design and structure are critical in web development because they create a user-friendly
          experience that is accessible to all. Proper design ensures that content is readable, visually appealing, and
          navigable for users with varying needs, including those relying on assistive technologies. Strong semantic
          structure improves usability, search engine optimization (SEO), and helps developers maintain and extend code
          easily.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Primary Color:</strong> The primary color I chose is blue because it conveys trust,
                professionalism, and calmness.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Secondary Color:</strong> The secondary color is white, chosen for its clean and neutral
                qualities.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Tertiary Color:</strong> The tertiary color is a darker blue, selected for its complementary
                qualities with the primary blue while adding depth and contrast.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Selection Process:</strong> To choose these colors, I considered color psychology and tested
                combinations for aesthetic appeal and accessibility using tools like Adobe Color and contrast checkers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Application of Colors:</strong> Blue is used for buttons and headings, providing a strong and
                professional emphasis. White is applied as the background to ensure a clean, uncluttered interface that
                makes other elements stand out. The darker blue is used for secondary accents, such as borders, hover
                states, or text, to emphasize important content and maintain a cohesive design.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Contrast Ratios:</strong> The contrast between the darker blue elements and the white background
                exceeds the WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirement of 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for larger elements,
                ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments.

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Body Font:</strong> The body font chosen is "Open Sans," a sans-serif font known for its
                legibility across devices and sizes.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Sizing, Weight, and Colors:</strong> Font sizes are 16px for body text and larger sizes for
                headings to establish a clear hierarchy. Weights range from regular for paragraphs to bold for emphasis,
                ensuring readability. Fonts are dark grey against a white background, ensuring high contrast.

          <p>
            The layout follows a traditional hierarchy, with navigation at the top, followed by a clear header, main
            content, and footer. Elements are arranged logically to match reading order, starting from left to right and
            top to bottom. This structure ensures that users can quickly locate what they're looking for without

            relying on keyboard navigation—can easily track where they are. Visual indicators such as underlining or
            color changes are used to provide accessibility and intuitive interaction.

            supported without breaking the layout or hiding important information.
          </p>
